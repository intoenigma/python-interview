# Python Test Preparation: 100 Questions

---

## Level: Easy (Questions 1-20)

---

**Question 1:** What is the data type of the value `10.5`?

> **Your Answer:** "This is a Float Cuz the integer valur which have decimal is called float"
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** Your understanding is correct. The official term is `float`.

---

**Question 2:** What will `print("Hello" + " " + "World")` output?

> **Your Answer:** "This called concanetate the string and it will print like this = Hello World"
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** The output is exactly `Hello World`. The process is called string concatenation.

---

**Question 3:** Create a variable named `my_age` and assign your age to it.

> **Your Answer:** `my_age = 20`
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** This is the correct way to declare and assign a variable.

---

**Question 4:** What is the output of `5 % 2`?

> **Your Answer:** 2.5
>
> **Rating:** 0/5 - Incorrect.
>
> **Correction:** The correct output is `1`. The modulo operator (`%`) gives the remainder of a division. 5 divided by 2 is 2, with a remainder of 1.

---

**Question 5:** What will `print("Ha" * 4)` output?

> **Your Answer:** HaHaHaHa
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** This is the correct output. The `*` operator repeats the string.

---

**Question 6:** A list is created as `fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`. How do you access `"banana"`?

> **Your Answer:** `print(fruits[2])`
>
> **Rating:** 0/5 - Incorrect.
>
> **Correction:** The correct way is `fruits[1]`. List indexing in Python starts from 0, so `"apple"` is at index 0, and `"banana"` is at index 1.

---

**Question 7:** What is the function to get the number of items in a list?

> **Your Answer:** len
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** The function is `len()`. For example, `len(fruits)` would return 3.

---

**Question 8:** What will `bool(0)` evaluate to?

> **Your Answer:** False
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** Correct. Zero, empty collections (like an empty list `[]`), and `None` all evaluate to `False`.

---

**Question 9:** Write a line of code that prints the text `"Python is fun"`.

> **Your Answer:** `print("Python is fun")`
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** This is the perfect way to do it.

---

**Question 10:** What is the result of `10 / 2`? What is its data type?

> **Your Answer:** 5
>
> **Rating:** 2/5 - Partially correct.
>
> **Correction:** The result is `5.0`. In Python 3, standard division (`/`) always results in a `float` data type.

---

**Question 11:** If `x = 5`, what is the output of `print(x > 3 and x < 10)`?

> **Your Answer:** 5
>
> **Rating:** 0/5 - Incorrect.
>
> **Correction:** The correct output is `True`. The expression checks if both conditions are true. Since 5 is greater than 3 AND less than 10, the entire expression evaluates to the boolean value `True`.

---

**Question 12:** How do you write a single-line comment in Python?

> **Your Answer:** "using hastag #"
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** You use the hash (`#`) symbol. Any text following `#` on that line is ignored by Python.

---

**Question 13:** Convert the string `"100"` to an integer.

> **Your Answer:** `a = 100 \b = int(a) ...`
>
> **Rating:** 3/5 - The logic is mostly correct, but the initial variable was not a string.
>
> **Correction:** A more direct way is: `int("100")`. This directly converts the string value to an integer.

---

**Question 14:** What is the output of the `if/else` code?

> **Your Answer:** "The answer will be B"
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** Correct. The condition `5 > 10` is false, so the `else` block is executed.

---

**Question 15:** How do you get the last item from a list `my_list`?

> **Your Answer:** `print(my_list[-1])`
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** This is the standard and most Pythonic way to get the last item.

---

**Question 16:** What is the keyword to create a function in Python?

> **Your Answer:** def
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** Correct. Function definitions start with `def`.

---

**Question 17:** What is the output of `10 // 3`?

> **Your Answer:** 3
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** This is correct. The `//` operator is for "floor division," which discards the decimal part.

---

**Question 18:** Create an empty list called `data`.

> **Your Answer:** `list(data)`
>
> **Rating:** 0/5 - Incorrect.
>
> **Correction:** The correct way is `data = []` or `data = list()`. Your answer would try to convert an existing (but undefined) variable `data` into a list.

---

**Question 19:** What is the data type of `True`?

> **Your Answer:** bool
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** Correct. It's of the type `bool` (boolean).

---

**Question 20:** How do you check if a value `5` is present in a list `numbers`?

> **Your Answer:** I D K
>
> **Rating:** 0/5.
>
> **Correction:** You can use the `in` keyword. For example: `if 5 in numbers:`. This expression will be `True` if 5 is found in the list.

---

## Level: Medium (Questions 21-40)

---

**Question 21:** Write a `for` loop that prints numbers from 0 to 4.

> **Your Answer:**
> ```python
> i = 0
> for i in range(0,4):
>     print(i + 1)
> ```
>
> **Rating:** 1/5 - Incorrect.
>
> **Correction:** This code prints numbers from 1 to 4. The question asks for numbers from 0 to 4. `range(0,4)` generates numbers 0, 1, 2, 3. A correct solution would be `for i in range(5): print(i)`.

---

**Question 22:** What is the output of this code?
> ```python
> my_string = "Python"
> print(my_string[1:4])
> ```

> **Answer:** `ytho`
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** Slicing `[1:4]` extracts characters from index 1 up to (but not including) index 4.

---

**Question 23:** How do you add the item `50` to the end of a list called `nums`?

> **Answer:**
> ```python
> num_1  = [10,20,30,40]
> num_2  = [50]
> print(num_1+num_2)
> ```
>
> **Rating:** 2/5 - Partially correct logic, but doesn't follow the instruction.
>
> **Correction:** The question asks to add an item to a pre-existing list called `nums`. The correct method is `.append()`.
> ```python
> nums.append(50)
> ```

---

**Question 24:** Create a dictionary `person` with a key `"name"` and value `"John"`.

> **Answer:**
> ```python
> d = {
>     name:John
> }
> ```
>
> **Rating:** 1/5 - Incorrect syntax.
>
> **Correction:** Keys and values that are strings must be enclosed in quotes.
> ```python
> person = {
>     "name": "John"
> }
> ```

---

**Question 25:** How do you get the value associated with the key `"age"` from a dictionary `d`?

> **Answer:**
> ```python
> din = {
>     "age":5,
>     "name":"john"
> }
> 
> print(din["age"])
> ```
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** This is the standard way to access a value by its key. Using `d.get("age")` is a safer alternative that returns `None` if the key doesn't exist, preventing an error.

---

**Question 26:** Write a function `add` that takes two numbers and returns their sum.

> **Answer:**
> ```python
> def add(a,b)
>     print(a+b)
> 
> add()
> ```
>
> **Rating:** 2/5 - Incorrect implementation.
>
> **Correction:** The function should `return` the sum, not print it. Also, the function was called without arguments, which would cause an error. A colon is missing after `def add(a,b)`.
> ```python
> def add(a, b):
>     return a + b
> ```

---

**Question 27:** What does the `.upper()` method do on a string?

> **Answer:** it make the alphabetic character capital
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** Correct. For example, `"hello".upper()` returns `"HELLO"`.

---

**Question 28:** Write a `while` loop that prints `"Hello"` 3 times.

> **Answer:** I D K
>
> **Rating:** 0/5.
>
> **Correction:** A `while` loop continues as long as its condition is true.
> ```python
> count = 0
> while count < 3:
>     print("Hello")
>     count += 1
> ```

---

**Question 29:** What is the output of this code?
> ```python
> my_list = [1, 2, 3]
> my_list.append([4, 5])
> print(len(my_list))
> ```

> **Answer:** 4
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** The list `[4, 5]` is added as a single, nested element to `my_list`, so the total length becomes 4.

---

**Question 30:** How do you remove the last element from a list `items` and get its value?

> **Answer:** `del din["age"]`
>
> **Rating:** 0/5 - Incorrect.
>
> **Correction:** Your answer is for deleting a dictionary key. To remove the last item from a list and get its value, you use the `.pop()` method.
> ```python
> last_item = items.pop()
> ```

---

**Question 31:** What is the difference between a list and a tuple?

> **Answer:** list is mutable and tuple is immutable
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** This is the key difference. "Mutable" means the object's contents can be changed after it is created. "Immutable" means they cannot.

---

**Question 32:** How do you check if a key `"city"` exists in a dictionary `person_data`?

> **Answer:**
> ```python
> if din == "age":
>     print("hello")
> ```
>
> **Rating:** 0/5 - Incorrect.
>
> **Correction:** You should use the `in` keyword to check for the existence of a key in a dictionary.
> ```python
> if "city" in person_data:
>     print("City exists!")
> ```

---

**Question 33:** What is the output of `3 ** 3`?

> **Answer:** 27
>
> **Rating:** 5/5 - Correct.
>
> **Correction:** The `**` operator is used for exponentiation (3 to the power of 3).

---

**Question 34:** How do you split the string `"apple,banana,cherry"` into a list of strings?

> **Answer:** You can use the `.split()` string method. You provide the character you want to split by as an argument.
> ```python
> my_string = "apple,banana,cherry"
> my_list = my_string.split(',')
> print(my_list) # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
> ```

---

**Question 35:** Write a function that takes a list and returns its first element.

> **Answer:**
> ```python
> def get_first_element(data_list):
>     if data_list: # Check if the list is not empty
>         return data_list[0]
>     return None # Return None if the list is empty
> ```

---

**Question 36:** What is the purpose of the `elif` keyword?

> **Answer:** `elif` is short for "else if." It is used in conditional statements (`if`/`else` blocks) to check for additional conditions after the initial `if` statement. If the `if` condition is false, Python checks the `elif` conditions in order. The first one that is true has its code block executed, and the rest of the `if/elif/else` structure is skipped.

---

**Question 37:** How do you combine a list of strings `words = ["Python", "is", "fun"]` into a single string separated by spaces?

> **Answer:** You use the `.join()` string method. The string you call the method on acts as the separator.
> ```python
> words = ["Python", "is", "fun"]
> result = " ".join(words)
> print(result)  # Output: Python is fun
> ```

---

**Question 38:** What will this code print?
> ```python
> for i in range(5):
>     if i == 3:
>         break
>     print(i)
> ```

> **Answer:** The code will print:
> ```
> 0
> 1
> 2
> ```
> The `break` statement terminates the loop when `i` is 3, so the number 3 and subsequent numbers are not printed.

---

**Question 39:** How do you open a file named `data.txt` in read mode?

> **Answer:** You can use the `open()` function. The most common and safest way is with a `with` statement, which ensures the file is automatically closed.
> ```python
> with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
>     # You can now read from the file, for example:
>     content = file.read()
>     # print(content)
> ```
> The `'r'` argument specifies read mode. If you omit it, `'r'` is used by default.

---

**Question 40:** What is the difference between `=` and `==` in Python?

> **Answer:**
> -   `=` is the **assignment operator**. It is used to assign a value to a variable (e.g., `x = 5`).
> -   `==` is the **equality comparison operator**. It is used to check if two values are equal, and it returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) (e.g., `x == 5`).

---

## Level: Hard (Questions 41-100)

---

**Question 41:** Write a list comprehension to create a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 10.

> **Answer:**
> ```python
> squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11)]
> ```

---

**Question 42:** What is a decorator in Python and what is a common use case?

> **Answer:** A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument, adds some kind of functionality, and then returns another function. A common use case is for logging, timing a function's execution, or access control.

---

**Question 43:** What is the output of this code and why?
> ```python
> def my_func(my_list=[]):
>     my_list.append(1)
>     print(my_list)
> 
> my_func()
> my_func()
> ```

> **Answer:** The output will be:
> ```
> [1]
> [1, 1]
> ```
> **Why:** The default list `my_list` is created only once when the function is defined. It is a mutable default argument. Each subsequent call to `my_func()` without an argument reuses and modifies the same list, rather than creating a new empty one.

---

**Question 44:** What is the difference between `*args` and `**kwargs` in function definitions?

> **Answer:** `*args` and `**kwargs` are used to allow a function to accept a variable number of arguments.
> -   `*args` collects any number of positional arguments into a tuple.
> -   `**kwargs` collects any number of keyword arguments into a dictionary.

---

**Question 45:** What is a generator? Write a simple generator function that yields numbers from 0 to `n`.

> **Answer:** A generator is a special type of iterator, which you can iterate over but you can't access elements by index. They are memory-efficient because they produce items one at a time and only when required.
> ```python
> def number_generator(n):
>     for i in range(n + 1):
>         yield i
> ```
